Description:

I started making this game toward the end of my junior year. I'm pretty proud of it despite its unfinished nature. I love the simple two-dimensional shapes in contrast with the extremely detailed appendages. I asked the Super Smash Bros. club at my school to test it and they had a lot of fun with it. I never finished the multiplayer part because networking is something I need to learn more about and work on, but by playing a previous version you will get a better sense of how the game works.
