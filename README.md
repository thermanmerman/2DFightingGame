Description:

I started making the 2D Fighting Game toward the end of my junior year. Iâ€™m like how the simple two-dimensional shapes contrast with the extremely detailed appendages. I asked the Super Smash Bros. club at my school to test the game and they had a lot of fun with it. I never finished the multiplayer part because networking is something I need to learn more about, but by playing a previous version you can get a better sense of how the game works.
