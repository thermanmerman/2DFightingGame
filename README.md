Description:

I started making this game toward the end of my junior year of highschool. I never came up with a name for it, but I'm pretty proud of it despite its unfinished nature.
Eventually I wanted to get some play testers, so I took it to the Super Smash Bros. club in my school and they had a lot of fun with it.
