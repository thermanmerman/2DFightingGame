Description:

I started making this game toward the end of my junior year of high school. I never came up with a name for it, but I'm pretty proud of it despite its unfinished nature.
Eventually I wanted to get some play testers, so I took it to the Super Smash Bros. club in my school and they had a lot of fun with it.
I also never finished the multiplayer part because networking is really hard and that is definitely reflected in my commit messages. I'm not too sure of the extent to which it works after I started working on the networking, so maybe revert to a previous version if you want to give it a try.
